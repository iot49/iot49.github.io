    "# Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the list of parts used in the project. You will also need a solderless protoboard and wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microcontroller\n",
    "\n",
    "Code samples are written for an ESP32. The particular model I'm using is a [Huzzah32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405), but other versions will work, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, here is the pinout:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/huzzah32-pinout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using a load cell [similar to this one](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14728). Choose lower or higher weight rating, depending on your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Buttons & Display\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience I'm using a [FeatherWing OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2900) that stacks directly on top of the Huzzah32, with no wiring required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board also has three buttons, connected to pins as follows: A=15, B=32, C=14.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HX711\n",
    "\n",
    "The [HX711](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879) is an ADC specialized to reading load cells. It gives better accuracy than the ADC built into the ESP32\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture below shows the assembled scale with the display mounted on top of the Huzzah32. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/scale.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "I used laser cut acrylic for the load cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/acrylic.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The load cell is \"sandwiched\" between the base and the tray, with a spacer on either side to permit it to allow it to move. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/scale_side.jpg)\n",
