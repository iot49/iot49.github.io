    "It works as follows: The Raspberry PI monitors `SHUT_DN` (GPIO13). Once a button press is detected, first starts a program on the STM32 and then shuts down Linux.\n",

The `AUX` pin (GPIO16) is configured (dtoverlay) to go when the Raspberry PI is off and monitored by the STM32. After the pin goes low, the STM32 waits for a brief period and then pulls `PWR_EN` low, disabling the 5V supply and consequently cutting power to the Raspberry PI and the STM32.\n",
